# ADR-004: Art Asset Pipeline

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-01-21

## Context

We need to decide how to create art assets (sprites, backgrounds, UI elements) for "Feed the Pups."

Requirements:
- Cartoon style with bright colors (greens, blues)
- Kid-friendly aesthetic
- Multiple dog breeds
- Various backgrounds (kitchen, living room, etc.)
- UI elements (buttons, HUD)
- Animations (dog movements, catch reactions, mouse)

Constraints:
- Minimal budget ($0-50 for assets)
- No professional artist on team
- Learning project (quality doesn't need to be AAA)

## Decision

**[TO BE DECIDED]**

Options under consideration:

### Option A: AI-Generated Art
- Use AI tools (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) to generate base assets
- Touch up in free tools (GIMP, Krita)
- **Pros:** Fast, cheap, consistent style achievable with good prompting
- **Cons:** May need iteration, animation requires frame-by-frame work
- **Cost:** $0-20 depending on AI credits

### Option B: Asset Store / Free Assets
- Use free game assets from itch.io, OpenGameArt, Kenney
- Customize colors/style as needed
- **Pros:** Immediately usable, professionally made
- **Cons:** May not match exact vision, mixing styles can look inconsistent
- **Cost:** $0-30

### Option C: Hand-Drawn (Simple Style)
- Draw simple assets in Krita/Procreate
- Lean into a charming "amateur" style
- **Pros:** Unique, personal, daughter could help
- **Cons:** Time-consuming, requires drawing ability
- **Cost:** $0 (tools are free or already owned)

### Option D: Hybrid Approach
- AI for backgrounds and complex assets
- Simple hand-drawn or asset pack items for smaller elements
- Mix and match based on what works
- **Pros:** Flexible, best of all worlds
- **Cons:** Style consistency may vary

## Recommendation

**Option D (Hybrid)** - Start with AI-generated art for backgrounds and base dog sprites, supplement with free asset packs for UI elements, and hand-draw simple items if desired. This maximizes flexibility while keeping costs near zero.
