# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Feed the Pups project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Template

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Context:** What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
- **Decision:** What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
- **Consequences:** What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
- **Alternatives Considered:** What other options were evaluated?
