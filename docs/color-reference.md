## Usage Guidelines

1. **Contrast:** Always ensure text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds. Use Charcoal (`#2C3E50`) on light backgrounds.

2. **Consistency:** Use the same color for the same purpose across the game. Stars are always Sunshine Yellow. Grass is always Grass Green.

3. **Accessibility:** Avoid relying on color alone to convey information. Use shapes, icons, and text as well.

4. **Saturation:** These colors are intentionally bright and saturated to match the Bluey/Angry Birds aesthetic. Do not desaturate them.

5. **Outlines:** All game sprites should have a Charcoal outline (2-3px at standard resolution) for the cartoon look.
